# Architecture of OnOrbitROS

OnOrbitROS serves as a foundational platform for the study and development of on-orbit applications, leveraging the powerful
combination of ROS and Gazebo for hyper-realistic simulations.

For extended information about this framework, its architecture and some applications go to [doi](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.simpat.2023.102790).
